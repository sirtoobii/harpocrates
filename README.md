# Harpocrates
Harpocrates (Ancient Greek: Ἁρποκράτης) was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality. (_2019, Wikipedia_)

# Aim
The final aim of this project should be a web-page where a user can enter some text and then offering him the challenge to 
accomplish that he isn't greeted by the text he entered previously. Also we should explain to the user which techniques where
used to identify him regardless what action he had taken. I imagine something like:  
```
Hello again user. You entered the text "I am so cool" previously. We identified you using:
- Bla (1 out of xxxxx)
- Bli (45 out of xxxx)
- and Blu (1 out of xxxx)
```

# ToDo
- Gather a list of possible identification techniques
- Discuss and define which one make sense to implement
- Decide about the software architecture
- Setup a first prototype

# But whats about the other projects like this?
Yes, I know there is for example [panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) but in my opinion they are too technical for a
"normal" user.
